# CRA — Context Registry Agents

**What**
A governed context layer that makes AI agents use tools, systems, and proprietary knowledge correctly.

**How**
CARP resolves context and permitted actions. TRACE proves what happened.

**Why**
LLMs hallucinate. Enterprises need auditability. Creators need a way to publish operational knowledge.

## Core Components
- **CRA Runtime** – authoritative resolver and policy engine
- **CARP** – Context & Action Resolution Protocol (meaning)
- **TRACE** – Telemetry & Replay Contract (truth)
- **Atlases** – creator‑published context packages
- **CLI** – asynchronous, telemetry‑first UX

## Differentiators
1. Context is treated as a licensed, governed artifact
2. Runtime is authoritative — LLM narration is non‑authoritative
3. Telemetry is replayable, diffable, and audit‑grade
4. One Atlas works across Claude, OpenAI, Google ADK, MCP

## Business Model
Creators publish Atlases that can be free, paid, subscription, usage‑metered, or enterprise licensed. The platform certifies CARP/TRACE compliance and takes a revenue cut.

**Positioning:** "The context authority layer that makes agents reliable, governable, and provable."
