# Development Session Log

Session logging for CRA-Core development. Times are in UTC.

| Session | Timestamp (UTC) | Focus | Key Actions | Artifacts / Notes | Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 2025-12-27 22:23:33 | Baseline analysis | Reviewed repository, protocols, runtime/CLI status; drafted phased plan for validation, governance, CLI experience, execution enrichment, SaaS readiness, and marketplace path. | Analysis summary only; no code changes. | Start session-based implementation with telemetry and governance hardening. |
| 1 | 2025-12-27 22:28:34 | Session log + plan alignment | Created this development log to track sessions; confirmed instructions and readiness; validated CLI entrypoint. | docs/DEV_TRACK.md added to repo. | Prioritize schema validation for CARP/TRACE envelopes and policy/error TRACE coverage in next session. |
| 2 | 2025-12-27 22:34:44 | Validation + policy gate | Added JSON Schema validation for CARP request/response, TRACE events, and Atlas manifests; introduced policy engine for risk/platform gating; wired CLI validation command and runtime TRACE for validation/policy/runtime errors. | SchemaValidator + PolicyEngine modules; CLI validate; runtime validation/policy denial handling. | Extend adapter metadata checks and add replay/export trace workflows. |
| 3 | 2025-12-27 22:39:52 | Trace replay + adapter governance | Added TRACE store with manifest export, replay validation, and listing; expanded CLI with list/export/replay commands; enforced Atlas adapter presence/metadata and refreshed reference manifest. | TraceStore utility; CLI commands (`list-traces`, `export-trace`, `replay`); stricter adapter validation. | Simulate adapter invocation with TRACE action events and add licensing hooks. |
| 4 | 2025-12-28 00:36:49 | Action invocation + licensing and rate limits | Added runtime support for adapter action invocation with approvals, licensing gates, and rate limiting; introduced CLI `invoke-action` and `license-register` commands; updated governance docs. | New LicenseManager + RateLimiter utilities; runtime/CLI wiring; README/CLI/runtime docs updated. | Extend adapter metadata to carry rate limit hints and add conformance checks for license + approval telemetry. |
| 5 | 2025-12-28 00:43:09 | Adapter rate-limit hints + governance telemetry | Added explicit adapter/action rate-limit metadata with schema validation, runtime enforcement, and governance TRACE events for license denials, pending approvals, and rate limiting; refreshed reference Atlas and docs. | Updated atlas schema/manifest; runtime governance telemetry; conformance + CLI requirements refreshed. | Enforce context TTL/redaction in runtime responses and introduce adapter-specific approval workflows with evidence links. |
| 6 | 2025-12-28 06:14:20 | Identity + scope enforcement | Added AuthManager with token/scopes, CLI identity registration, and runtime enforcement of required_scopes with TRACE governance events; updated Atlas manifest, schemas, and docs. | AuthManager + identity file; CLI identity-register; scope-aware runtime + atlas metadata. | Wire scope metadata into conformance fixtures and add per-scope adapter tests. |
| 7 | 2025-12-28 16:24:33 | Context TTL enforcement + branch scan | Added context registry with TTL/redaction handling, artifact TRACE events, and docs/CLI expectations; verified no additional branches available to compare against. | `lock/context_registry.json` managed by runtime; TRACE artifact created/updated/redacted events; docs updated. | Add adapter-scope conformance fixtures and context refresh controls. |
| 8 | 2025-12-28 17:19:54 | Context refresh + adapter scope fixtures | Added CLI context-status/refresh controls and runtime refresh flag, expanded conformance/atlas docs with adapter scope fixture (`traces/fixtures/adapter_scopes.json`); confirmed branch scan unchanged. | ContextManager refresh/status helpers; CLI flags/commands; adapter scope fixture. | Use fixtures in replay/cert harness and extend adapter scope tests. |
| 9 | 2025-12-28 17:43:28 | Conformance harness + scope validation | Added ConformanceRunner with CLI `conformance` command, adapter scope/risk/rate checks, and docs updated for certification workflows. | `cra conformance` CLI; AllowedAction risk metadata; conformance docs refreshed. | Capture golden trace fixtures and expand rate-limit assertions in harness. |

## Active Workstream Outline
- **Validation & Telemetry Hardening (Next):** Formal schema validation at runtime boundaries; emit TRACE validation/runtime/adapter error events; strengthen policy/deny handling.
- **Atlas Governance & Adapter Depth (Upcoming):** Expand Atlas manifest validation, licensing hooks, and per-adapter constraints/approvals across OpenAI/Anthropic/Google ADK/MCP targets.
- **CLI & Developer Experience (Upcoming):** Add export/replay/golden-trace workflows, presets, and onboarding aids.
- **Execution Enrichment (Upcoming):** Simulated/sandboxed action invocation with rate limits and approval gating tied to risk tiers/scopes.
- **SaaS/Marketplace Readiness (Planned):** Pluggable TRACE storage, identity integrations, Atlas publishing/signing/metering, and certification harness for CARP/TRACE compliance.
