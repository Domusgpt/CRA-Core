# CRA - Elevator Pitch

## One Sentence

**CRA gives AI agents domain knowledge, records what they do, and enforces rules—without slowing them down.**

## 30 Seconds

AI agents are everywhere, but they're flying blind. They don't know your internal APIs. They can't prove what they did. They ignore governance because it's too slow.

CRA fixes this. It injects the right context at the right moment. It logs everything in the background. It enforces policies only when they matter.

The agent builds its own integration, so it understands and consents. The audit trail builds itself. Governance scales with risk.

**Result:** Agents that know what they should, do what they're allowed, and leave a trail of what they did.

## 60 Seconds

Every company deploying AI agents hits the same problems:

1. **Agents don't know your stuff.** They hallucinate APIs. They make preventable mistakes.
2. **No audit trail.** Something breaks, no one knows what the agent did.
3. **Governance kills speed.** Every action needs approval. Work stops.

CRA solves all three:

- **Context injection at checkpoints.** Not every prompt—just when it matters. Agents get domain knowledge exactly when they need it.
- **Async audit.** TRACE logs everything in the background. Hash-chained, tamper-proof, zero blocking.
- **Governance that scales.** Low-risk? Just log. High-risk? Require verification. You configure it per domain.

Here's the novel part: **the agent builds its own wrapper.** It constructs the integration during onboarding. By building it, the agent learns the system, actively consents, and gets a cryptographic identity.

No other system does this. CRA is the missing layer between agent intelligence and execution.

## The Hook

> "What if agents could prove what they knew, and you could prove what they did?"

That's CRA. Context they actually use. Audit trails that build themselves. Governance that doesn't get in the way.

## For Different Audiences

### For Developers

"Your agents will stop hallucinating your API. CRA injects the right docs at the right time, and logs everything they do. Drop-in, minimal overhead."

### For Enterprise

"Governance without grinding to a halt. Async audit trails. Cryptographic proof of what agents knew and agreed to. Scales from logging to full compliance."

### For Investors

"The governance layer for AI agents. As agents proliferate, everyone needs context injection, audit trails, and policy enforcement. CRA is that layer—async, scalable, agent-built integration."

### For Technical Leads

"CARP for context matching, TRACE for hash-chained audit, Atlas for domain packages. Agents build their own wrappers. Checkpoints, not every prompt. Async by default, sync when you need it."

## Key Differentiators

| Others | CRA |
|--------|-----|
| Inject context constantly | Inject at checkpoints |
| Blocking audit | Async, non-blocking |
| One-size-fits-all governance | Scales with risk |
| Pre-built integrations | Agent builds its own |
| Trust what agent says | Prove what agent knew |

---

## The Tagline

**CRA: Context, governance, and audit for AI agents—that actually works at scale.**
