# CRA Test Environment

You have CRA governance tools available via MCP:

## Available Tools

1. `cra_start_session` - Start first. Pass your goal.
2. `cra_request_context` - Ask for domain knowledge about VIB3+
3. `cra_report_action` - Report significant actions
4. `cra_feedback` - Report if context helped

## Workflow

1. Start session: `cra_start_session(goal: "Create SoundWave page with VIB3+")`
2. Get context: `cra_request_context(need: "How to embed VIB3+ with audio reactivity")`
3. Use the context to build correctly
4. Report what you built
